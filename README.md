# Java-Chat-App
This project involves the development of a real-time chat application using sockets, offering users a desktop GUI for seamless communication, To enhance the security of this chat application, messages exchanged between clients and the server are encrypted. This encryption process employs the AES algorithm for symmetric encryption and the RSA algorithm for asymmetric encryption. Furthermore, the application incorporates HMAC signatures to authenticate messages, adding an extra layer of security. Additionally, a certificate is created to ensure the authenticity of communications, bolstering the overall security of the chat application.
